Jake has a unique set of abilities called Stretchy Powers that allow                                him to manipulate the shape and size of his body, coming in handy on innumerable occasions throughout his and Finn's                              adventures. Jake was 28 years old as of his debut (he could possibly be in his 30's by now due to the aging of other                              characters) in magical dog years, though he rarely acts mature."</p>
